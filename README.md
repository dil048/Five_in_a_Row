# five_in_a_row
Five in a Row is an abstract strategy board game. Also called Gobang or Gomoku, it is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a 15x15 board ;[1] however, because pieces are not moved or removed from the board, gomoku may also be played as a paper and pencil game. This game is known in several countries under different names.

Black plays first if white did not win in the previous game, and players alternate in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
